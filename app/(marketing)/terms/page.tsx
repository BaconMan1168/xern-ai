          We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised Terms on this page
          with an updated effective date.
        </p>

          For material changes — such as changes to your rights, payment terms, or data handling — we will
          provide at least 14 days&rsquo; advance notice via email or a prominent in-app notice. Non-material changes
